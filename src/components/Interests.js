                <p>I like to spend time with family and friends. I like to explore new places with together such as resturants and parks. I am also a very big gamer. Most of my free time is spent playing video games, not something I'm proud of. But it does scratch the itch of wanting to travel and explore. It was the biggest way many people around the world dealt with the pandemic.</p>
